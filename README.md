# Transactions-api-challenege
This is an api that is completing the following code challenge:
https://github.com/namshi/coding-challenges/blob/master/transactions-at-the-bank.md


## Goals

My goal is to follow every requirement listed in the API challenge except for the following:
  - Building the API in NodeJS (I'll be choosing the latest version of Spring Boot)
  - "Try not to use an ORM" (I'm going to use an ORM)
  
Some of my other areas of focus for this project will be:
  - CI/CD - Auto deploy master branch to 'prod' version 
  - Good unit testing logic & coverage
  - Caching layer so if DB is down payments are queued
